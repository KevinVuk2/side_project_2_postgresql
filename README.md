# Wholesale Revenue Analysis by Product Line

This project analyzes wholesale sales data from a company operating three warehouses. The goal is to calculate net revenue by product line, grouped by month and warehouse, in order to better understand revenue trends and support decision-making at the board level.

# Analysis Overview

This notebook uses SQL queries on the sales dataset to investigate revenue performance. The primary question explored is:


How does wholesale revenue vary across product lines, months, and warehouses?

The analysis filters the data to include only wholesale orders. It then groups results by product line, month, and warehouse, calculating key metrics:

Net revenue per product line: To identify top-performing categories.

Revenue trends by month: To examine seasonal patterns (Juneâ€“August 2021).

Revenue breakdown by warehouse: To compare performance across North, Central, and West warehouses.

The results help visualize how revenue is distributed and where performance differences arise between locations and time periods.

# Technologies Used

PostgreSQL (for data extraction and aggregation)
